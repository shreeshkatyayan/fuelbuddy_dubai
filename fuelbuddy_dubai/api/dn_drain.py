"""
Production drain for back-dated Delivery Notes.

Workflow per batch:
  1. Pick draft DNs in a (customer, date-range, item-warehouse) window.
  2. Pre-flight every draft against a Redis shadow of tabBin (negative-stock
     check) — skips doomed drafts before they hit the submit chain.
  3. Engage 4 monkey-patch flags (defined in fuelbuddy_dubai/__init__.py):
       fb_skip_repost              — skip per-submit Repost Item Valuation
       fb_skip_future_sle_update   — skip update_qty_in_future_sle wide UPDATE
       fb_skip_bin_update          — skip per-submit tabBin row update
       fb_skip_billing_status      — skip per-submit SO/SI billing recompute
  4. Submit each DN through ERPNext's standard doc.submit() — the patches make
     all four deferred operations no-op while flags are set. Apply atomic
     decrement to the Redis shadow per item.
  5. After the batch:
       a. Park any RIVs that got auto-queued despite the patch (defence in
          depth; should be 0) — INHERITING their anchors, see below.
       b. Run ONE consolidated Repost Item Valuation for the hot key from the
          earliest of (this batch's earliest posting_date, every anchor we
          parked). This recomputes:
            - tabStock Ledger Entry: valuation_rate, stock_value,
              stock_value_difference, qty_after_transaction
            - tabGL Entry: deletes stale per-submit GLs, reinserts with
              correct values via repost_gle_for_stock_vouchers
            - tabBin: actual_qty, stock_value, valuation_rate, stock_queue
       c. SQL recompute of SO Item.delivered_qty and SO.per_delivered from
          authoritative DN rows (replacing what skip_billing_status deferred).
       d. Reconcile shadow vs tabBin. Drift on actual_qty/reserved_qty must
          be float-precision noise (~1e-9). Any larger drift is a bug.
       e. Cleanup shadow keys.

Anchor inheritance (IDEV-3156):
  Parking a pending RIV without adopting its anchor silently destroys a
  valuation repair that ERPNext had already queued. Production had 1,534
  Skipped RIVs with anchors from 2026-06-01 to 2026-09-01 against only 3
  Completed, and 22 unhealed valuation-chain breaks as the result.

  The invariant this module now holds:

      the consolidated repost is NEVER anchored later than any repost it
      supersedes

  `resolve_repost_anchor` is the pure statement of that rule and is unit
  tested without a site; `_quiesce_pending_rivs` is its DB shell.

  'In Progress' rows are a special case: we cannot tell a genuinely-running
  repost from a zombie (one that died mid-walk and was left In Progress) from
  SQL alone, so we adopt their anchor but leave their status untouched and
  surface them in the result for a human to clear.

Identity guarantee:
  Field-by-field diff against native ERPNext submit + consolidated repost
  on the same input set produces 0 diffs on SLE, GL, and Bin (verified at
  100-DN scale, April 6 NFPC, crossing 13 GRN events).

Performance (measured):
  Submit phase: ~120ms/doc with patches engaged (vs ~9.4s/doc native).
  Consolidated repost: ~0.6s/SLE row walked.
  SO billing recompute: <5 seconds for any batch size (it's a SQL aggregate).

Projection for 95k DN drain on prod hardware:
  ~3.2h submit + ~1.2h repost = ~4.5h total — fits one off-hours window.
